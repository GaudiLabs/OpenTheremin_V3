## Open.Theremin V3 control software 

Arduino UNO Software for the Open.Theremin
- This is the "Academy edition" with improved volume control 
- get both a more consistent response at low volumes and a dynamic range of up to 73.6dB
- a contribution by Thierry Frenkel.

### Open Source Theremin based on the Arduino Platform

Open.Theremin is an arduino shield to build the legendary music instrument invented by Leon Theremin back in 1920. The theremin is played with two antennas, one to control the pitch and one for volume. The electronic shield with two ports to connect those antennas comprises two heterodyne oscillators to measure the distance of the hand to the antenna when playing the instrument. The resulting signal is fed into the arduino. After linearization and filtering the arduino generates the instruments sound that is then played through a high quality digital analog audio converter on the board. The characteristics of the sound can be determined by a wave table on the arduino.
